Tealeaf Academy: rock paper scissors app

Each ruby file in this repo is a different version of the game Rock Paper Scissors. 

rock_paper_scissors.rb
This is my original version. It uses an array for "Rock", "Papaer", and "Scissors." It's got some redundant code and doesn't handle errors.

rps_hash_refactor.rb
This version is an incomplete version that uses a hash instead of an array for the weapons. It includes links ot other people's solutions. 

oop_rps.rb
This version is the most tidy version. It uses methods and has no redundancy. I am considering doing another version that incorporates Classes.
